This is sample To-Do list app using Django. 
My Initial learnings 
Learning Log 01: Learned about, Virtual environment, Starting project and app! Connecting the app with "url", templates to save html files, bootstrap navbar, jinja syntax "extends, include, blockcontent" and Git account creation and initialize the project and push to Github. 
Progress : Pushed upto the navbar settings and added README.md first time, even if this is not the way to document.
